              <li> In 1986, on The Phil Donahue Show, Rogers told the audience that he was the first person in his family "as far back as we know" to
                  graduate from high school. "We were broke. We lived in a federal housing project. I think the most money my father ever made was $75 a week. </li>
              <li>In 1949, Rogers won a talent show at the Texan Theatre. He served as a busboy at the Rice Hotel and swept floors at a hat store for $9 a week.

              <li> In 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most
                   popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles. The song

              <li> The next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular

              <br>
              <br>
              <li> Music should make you laugh, make you think If it doesn't
                   do one of those three things, then you're wasting everybody's time</li>
              <li> Youth is a frame of mind. If you get out there and enjoy it, you can have
                   it at any time of your life.</li>
              <li> You need three things in your life to be happy: someone to love, something
                   to do and something to look forward to. </li>
              <li> You can't make old friends. You either have them or you don't.</li>
              <li> There's a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are.
                   Think about that before you judge.</li>
              <li>If you want people to know what your message is, just sing it.</li>
              <li>I'm so totally future oriented that, for me, I don't know what the future's about, but
                  I can promise you it's gonna be exciting.</li>
              <li>Stay away from trouble when you can.</li>
              <li>Here's what I've learned about raising boys... If you keep 'em busy, they're fine.
                  You let 'em get bored, they'll dismantle your house board by board.</li>
              <li>It is difficult to get played at my age on the radio.</li>
              <li>There is a trade-off - as you grow older you gain wisdom, but you lose spontaneity.</li>
